## Console_Exam_Dec2016_Solution
* Example of how to implement a menu system using a variable-based finite state machine (https://brilliant.org/wiki/finite-state-machines).
* A different approach to this question which doesn't require multiple nested while loops, so might be interesting to review.
* Also uses an object to group user data variables together (user_data class), and switch-case statements for neater branching.
* This implementation is deliberately a little over complicated to communicate some alternate methods. See "Console_Exam_Practise_Feb2019_Solution" if you'd like to see something less advanced.
