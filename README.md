# SOUD1416 Practise Exams

As you guys are probably aware, in programming there are multiple ways to achieve the same outcome.
My aim with these solutions is to communicate a variety of different approaches / C# language features, so take from them what you wish.
Each solution is well commented to aid the understanding of each code section.

You'll find the odd silly addition, which was my attempt at staying awake throughout :) Let's face it, these programs are quite pointless! (no offence Andy)

Just message me if you have any questions.

Hope these help, and good luck with the rest of the module!

Cheers,
D

## Console_Exam_Dec2016_Solution
* Example of how to implement a menu system using a state machine. Similar to how sequential function chart works for PLCs (transitioning between different operating states).
* A different approach to this question which doesn't require multiple nested while loops, so might be interesting to see.
* Also uses classes / structures for grouping variables together (user_data class), and switch-case statements for neater tests on a single variable / expression.

More to follow...
