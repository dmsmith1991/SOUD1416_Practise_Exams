# SOUD1416 Practise Exams

As you guys are probably aware, in programming there are multiple ways to achieve the same outcome. The below solutions are just my personal take on how to meet the given briefs, deliberately using a variety of methods to expose you to some of the more common approaches.

* A different approach to this question which doesn't require multiple nested while loops, so might be interesting to see.
* Also uses classes / structures for grouping variables together (user_data class), and switch-case statements for neater tests on a single variable / expression.
