# SOUD1416 (Programming Concepts) Practise Exams

As you guys are probably aware, in programming there are multiple ways to achieve the same outcome.
My aim with these solutions is to cover a variety of different methods / C# language features, so learn from whatever appeals.
Each solution is well commented to aid the understanding of each part of the code.

*Worth Mentioning*
* I don't personally use the "camel case" naming convention, so you won't see this throughout.
* You'll find the odd silly addition, which was my attempt at staying awake throughout :) Let's face it, these programs are quite pointless! (no offence Andy)
* See the readme for each solution for notes.

Feel free to message me if you have any questions.

Hope these help, and good luck with the rest of the module!

Cheers,
D
