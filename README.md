# SOUD1416 Practise Exams

As you guys are probably aware, in programming there are multiple ways to achieve the same outcome. The provided solutions are just my personal take on how to complete the given practise tasks, with the odd silly addition to keep boredom at bay (let's face it, these programs are pretty pointless).

My aim is to communicate a variety of different approaches / C# language features, so take from them what you wish.
Each solution is well commented to aid the understanding of each line.

Hope this helps, and good luck with the rest of the module!

Cheers,
D

## Console_Exam_Dec2016_Solution
* Example of how to implement a menu system using a state machine. Similar to how sequential function chart works for PLCs (transitioning between different operating states).
* A different approach to this question which doesn't require multiple nested while loops, so might be interesting to see.
* Also uses classes / structures for grouping variables together (user_data class), and switch-case statements for neater tests on a single variable / expression.
