# SOUD1416 Practise Exams

As you guys are probably aware, in programming there are multiple ways to achieve the same outcome.
My aim with these solutions is to communicate a variety of different approaches / C# language features, so take from them what you wish.
Each solution is well commented to aid the understanding of each part of the code.

You'll find the odd silly addition, which was my attempt at staying awake throughout :) Let's face it, these programs are quite pointless! (no offence Andy)

See the readme for each solution for notes, and message me if you have any questions.

Hope these help, and good luck with the rest of the module!

Cheers,
D
